# API

Placeholder for portfolio API services.

## TODO

- [ ] **Golang + GraphQL** — Consider implementing a lightweight API in Go with GraphQL for:
    - Sending emails (contact form, notifications)
    - No database — keep it stateless for a simple portfolio
- [ ] Use [gqlgen](https://gqlgen.com/) or similar for GraphQL
- [ ] Deploy as Vercel serverless function or separate service (Fly.io, Railway)
